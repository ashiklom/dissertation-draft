Here go all your acknowledgments. You know, your advisor, funding agency, lab
mates, etc., and of course your family.

As for me, I would like to thank Jonathan Polimeni for cleaning up old LaTeX
style files and templates so that Engineering students would not have to suffer
typesetting dissertations in MS Word. Also, I would like to thank IDS/ISS
group (ECE) and CV/CNS lab graduates for their contributions and tweaks to this
scheme over the years (after many frustrations when preparing their final
document for BU library). In particular, I would like to thank Limor Martin who
has helped with the transition to PDF-only dissertation format (no more printing
hardcopies -- hooray !!!)

The stylistic and aesthetic conventions implemented in this LaTeX
thesis/dissertation format would not have been possible without the help from
Brendan McDermot of Mugar library and Martha Wellman of CAS.

Finally, credit is due to Stephen Gildea for the MIT style file off which this
current version is based, and Paolo Gaudiano for porting the MIT style to one
compatible with BU requirements.
