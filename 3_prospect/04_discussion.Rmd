# Discussion

- Analysis of needle decline complementary to efforts to study of hemlock decline using IS [@hanavan_2015_hemlock]

- Leaf traits with respect to canopy height
  - [@gara_2018_impact] -- N, Chl, C, water, and LMA higher in canopy leaves than shaded leaves (TODO: mass or area?)

- Re-calibration of PROSPECT to include more stuff
  - [@wang_2015_applicability] -- new version of PROSPECT with better protein (calibrated on LOPEX only).
  - [@wang_2018_mapping] -- leaf nitrogen via protein content

- Synthesis of spectral datasets from a wide range of sources useful for re-calibration of PROSPECT [e.g. @wang_2015_applicability].
  Initiatives like ECOSIS to make data available massively help such endeavors.
