\subsection{Modeling leaf optical properties}

Significant in results between PROSPECT versions for the same traits.
All PROSPECT versions use the same absorption coefficients for leaf water and dry matter contents, which explains why agreement for them was generally good.
However, there are differences in the refractive index between versions 4, 5/5B, and D, which may contribute to differences in inversion estimates of water and dry matter.

Significant changes in pigment coefficients across different generations of PROSPECT lead to significant changes in pigment estimates.
In particular, PROSPECT D's separation of carotenoids and anthocyanins led to significant disagreement in estimates of carotenoids.
