\section{Conclusions}

This study is, to my knowledge, the first of its kind in synthesizing reflectance measurements from a wide collection of species and measurement conditions under a single common methodology.
For one, it provides a valuable contribution to remote sensing methodology by demonstrating the capabilities and limitations of trait retrieval via inversion of various versions of PROSPECT\@.
It is particularly novel in revealing that PROSPECT is able to detect and ascribe physiological meaning to plant responses to environmental conditions and acute stressors.
More generally, this study contributes to the growing body of literature evaluating the drivers of variability in plant functional traits and reinforces the importance of intraspecific variability in plant function.
Ultimately, this study showcases the value of leaf spectroscopy for ecology and agriculture.
