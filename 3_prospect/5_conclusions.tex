\section{Conclusions}

Leaf reflectance spectroscopy has been widely used to study plant functional traits.
This study is, to the authors' knowledge, the first of its kind in synthesizing reflectance measurements from a wide collection of species and measurement conditions under a single common methodology.
As such, this study is a valuable contribution to remote sensing methodology by demonstrating the capabilities and limitations of trait retrieval via inversion of various versions of PROSPECT\@.
In addition, it also adds to the rapidly growing body of literature evaluating the drivers of variability in plant functional traits, with a particularly strong emphasis on intraspecific variability that is increasingly recognized as important.
Ultimately, this study showcases the value of leaf spectroscopy for ecology and agriculture.
