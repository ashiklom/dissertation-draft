Vegetation is a critical component of the biosphere that mediates climate, modifies the hydrologic cycle, is a haven for biodiversity, and provides many natural resources~\cite{bonan_forests_2008}.
Unfortunately, current predictions about the future of the terrestrial biosphere are highly uncertain, as evidenced by the huge disparities in model projections of the magnitude and direction of the land carbon sink~\cite{friedlingstein_uncertainties_2014}.
Moreover, the overall pace of model improvement has been sluggish---for instance, global terrestrial biosphere model predictions were virtually equally uncertain in 2006 and 2014~\cite{friedlingstein_2006_climate,friedlingstein_uncertainties_2014}.
This lack of progress is particularly surprising given the explosion of novel data streams during the same period, such as the TRY global plant traits database~\cite{kattge2009_try}, the opening of the Landsat archive~\cite{woodcock_2008_free}, and the formation of global networks of eddy covariance measurements~\cite{baldocchi_2008_breathing}.
One can therefore conclude that these data streams are not being utilized to their full potential by the dynamic vegetation modeling community at large.
The overarching objectives of my research are to identify how these various data streams can be used, both independently and in combination, to add constraint on model predictions.

Vegetation models are typically parameterized in

The focus of my first chapter is on the TRY global plant traits database.
Plant functional traits are measurable 
Specifically, I explore the additional information content in trait correlations and explore the dependence of these correlations on ecological scale.
In the second chapter, I develop methods for obtaining new trait measurements from leaf reflectance spectra through Bayesian radiative transfer model inversion.
In the third chapter, I apply these methods to a large database of leaf spectra to explore the drivers of leaf trait variability, with a particular focus on intraspecific variability caused by environmental stress.
In my final chapter, I validate an ecosystem model by comparing its estimates of surface reflectance through time against satellite surface reflectance measurements.
